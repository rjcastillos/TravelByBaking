Cover and put in the fridge overnight.\nHeat the oven to 150\u00b0 C or 340\u00b0 F.\nWhen ready to bake, sift flour in the batter and mix thoroughly.\nInsert parchment paper or a silicone baking mat in a baking tray. Grease the parchment paper if you use it.\nPut approximately a teaspoon of batter on the baking tray and flatten it as much as possible without leaving gaps between the almond flakes. Dipping the teaspoon in cold water will help to prevent the batter from sticking to the spoon.\nBake the cookies for about 10 to 15 minutes till they are golden brown around the edges.\nRemove the cookies from the baking tray with the help of a sharper spatula. Put them on a piece of parchment paper or a cutting board in one layer and let them cool. The cookies will stick together if put on top of each other while still hot.\nEnjoy!"], "ServingSize": {"colName": "Serving Size:", "Size": "Makes about 30"}, "rTime": ["Time:", "Prep time: 10 min", "Wait time: overnight", "Bake time: 15 min"], "VideoUrl": {"src": "https://www.youtube.com/embed/LIyapAOc4u0?feature=oembed", "alt": "Almond cookies (tuiles aux amandes)"}}}
