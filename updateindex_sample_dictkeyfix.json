Made with a yeast dough base, creamy cottage cheese mid layer and thin fresh apple slices on top, sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar.\nA sheet cake made this way has been one of my favourites since childhood when baked on special occasions or just because of craving something sweet and delicious.\nIngredients\nFor the cottage cheese layer:\n450 \u2013 500 grams cottage cheese\n1 tablespoon flour\n1 egg\n70 grams sugar\n50 grams sour cream\nvanilla\nraisins (optional)\nFor the apple layer:\n3 medium size apples\n100 grams sugar\n2 eggs\n150 grams sour cream\n1 tablespoon flour\n2 teaspoons cinnamon\nEquipment\nThe baking tray I used is 40 x 30 cm or 11.81 x 15.75 inches.\nDirections\nFor the dough recipe and instructions see Soft and delicious mini bacon buns (Latvian piragi).\nPrepare the baking tray by inserting parchment paper and sprinkling some flour in it.\nSprinkle some flour on the kitchen countertop and remove the dough from the fridge.\nRoll the dough in a rectangle shape approximately the size of the baking tray and move it to the tray.\nAdjust the dough as needed so that it fits the size of the tray \u2013 there are no empty gaps and the dough is not up on the sides of the tray. Put the tray aside in a warm place for the dough to rest.\nSet the oven to heat to 180 degrees Celsius or 350 degrees Fahrenheit.\nIf using dry cottage cheese, either blend or rub it through a sieve as much as you can.\nAdd in the bowl the cottage cheese and all the ingredients for the cottage cheese layer \u2013 egg, sugar, sour cream, vanilla and flour. Mix it well together and put the bowl aside.\nMix the cinnamon with 2 teaspoons of sugar.\nMix the remaining sugar with eggs for the apple layer.\nAdd to it the sour cream and mix to dissolve the cream.\nAdd the flour and mix till the batter is smooth. Put it also aside.\nPeel and slice apples in thin slices.\nPut the cottage cheese mix on top of the dough and spread it to cover the whole sheet of dough.\nPut apple slices in rows on top of the cottage cheese and arrange them so that a layer of apples covers the whole cake.\nUsing a spoon, spread the egg, cream mix over the apples.\nSprinkle the sugar, cinnamon mix over the cake and put it in the oven to bake for approximately 30 minutes.\nRemove the cake from the oven and let it cool in the baking tray for a few minutes before moving it and cutting.\nEnjoy!"

      "Serving Size:\n12 \u2013 16 pieces\nTime:\nPrep time: 1 h\nWait time: up to 2 h\nBake time: 30 min\nDifficulty:\nMedium\nEquipment\nI am using a baking tray of size: 24.5 x 21 x 4 cm / 9.5 x 8.5 x 1.5 inches (fits 1.5 litres / 6.25 cups)\nIngredients\nFor the carrot layer:\n1 kg / 2.2 lbs carrots\n1/2 tsp salt\n3 eggs\n200 g / 1 cup granulated sugar\n2 tsp cinnamon or gingerbread spices\n50 g / 0.4 cups all-purpose flour\n100 g / 0.4 cups whipping cream\nFor the yeast dough base:\n70 ml / 0.3 cups milk (2% or full fat)\n15 g fresh yeast (or 6 g active dry yeast)\n150 g / 1.3 cups all-purpose flour\n40 g / 0.2 cups butter (unsalted)\n1/2 tbsp granulated sugar\n1/8 tsp salt\nDirections\nBoil carrots with 1/2 tsp salt till they are soft. Drain, leave to cool and peel.\nPut milk, butter, sugar and salt in a small pot and warm on medium heat till the butter melts. Let it cool so that it is fine to touch before adding to the yeast.\nCrumble yeast in a bowl, add to it about half of the warm milk and a few tablespoons of flour to activate it. Mix and leave for about 10 min till the yeast becomes bubbly and grows in volume.\nSift flour in a big bowl. Add to it the remaining milk and the yeast. Mix everything well to form consistent dough. If the dough is too sticky, add a tablespoon of flour at a time. The dough should not stick to hands or the bowl. Knead the dough on the kitchen countertop for a few minutes till it is smooth and elastic. Shape into a ball, put in a bowl, cover with a towel and leave in a warm place till the dough doubles in size. It can take an hour or two depending on how warm the place is where you put the dough.\nPut a piece of parchment paper in the baking tray so that it is easier to remove the cake when it\u2019s done. And grease the parchment paper with a bit of oil or butter.\nDust the kitchen countertop with a bit of flour and roll the dough thin, approximately in the size of the baking tray. Move the dough to the baking tray and fold the sides down so that the dough is only on the bottom of the baking tray. Cover the baking tray with a towel and leave the dough to rest while preparing the carrot filling.\nSet the oven to heat to 180 degrees Celsius or 400 degrees Fahrenheit.\nEither grate or blend the carrots. If blending, add eggs to the carrots in the blender.\nPut the carrot puree in a big bowl, add eggs if not done yet, about 3/4ts of the sugar, spices and flour. Mix everything well.\nPour the carrot mixture over the dough in the baking tray and level.\nMix the whipping cream with the remaining sugar and drizzle it over the carrot filling.\nBake the carrot sheet cake for about 30 min till the top of the cake looks set and has browned a little. Remove the cake from the oven and let it cool a little before removing from the baking tray.\nCut off the sides of the sheet cake to better see the layers and enjoy!"

      "Serving Size:\n1 big Roscon de Reyes\nTime:\nPrep time: 1 h\nWait time: 7 h\nBake time: 25 min\nDifficulty:\nMedium\n65 g / 0.3 cups milk (2% or full fat)\n35 g / 0.2 cups butter (unsalted)\n1 tsp granulated sugar\n15 g fresh yeast (or 6 g active dry yeast)\n250 \u2013 280 g / 2.1 \u2013 2.3 cups strong flour (bread flour)\n60 g / 0.5 cups powdered sugar\nZest of 1 small orange and 1 lemon\n2 eggs\n15 g / 1 tbsp orange flower water (optional)\nA pinch of salt\nFor decoration:\nCandied fruit (orange, lemon, cherries, etc.)\nAlmond flakes (optional)\n1 tbsp granulated sugar with a few drops of water\nDirections\nPut milk, 1 teaspoon of sugar and the butter in a small pot, and heat on the stove on low heat to melt the butter. When the butter has melted, leave the milk to cool for a few minutes.\nWhen the milk is just slightly warm, fine to touch, activate the yeast. Crumble the fresh yeast in a small bowl, add to it the milk with butter and sugar, and stir to dissolve the yeast a bit.\u00a0Mix in a few tablespoons of flour and leave it for about 10 min till the yeast is foamy.\nZest an orange and a lemon, and mix the zest with the powdered sugar.\nPut the activated yeast in a big bowl. Add to it one egg, powdered sugar mixed with the orange and lemon zest and orange flower water (optional), which is traditionally used in Roscon de Reyes.\nAdd a bit of salt to the flour and sift it in the bowl. Do not add all the flour at once in case you do not need it all for the dough.\u00a0If the dough is sticky, add a bit of flour, gradually \u2013 tablespoon, half a tablespoon, at a time till the dough starts to hold together and does not stick to the sides of the bowl any more.\nPut some cooking oil on your hands and the kitchen countertop. The oil will help to prevent the dough from sticking and there won\u2019t be more flour added to the dough to avoid adding too much flour to it. And knead the dough for a few minutes till it is smooth, elastic and does not stick any more. The dough should be soft and not need much strength to knead it.\nRoll the dough into a ball, pat with a little bit of oil to help to keep the dough moist and put it in the bowl. Cover the bowl with a towel or a lid and put in a warm place for the dough to grow for about 5 hours.\nWrap the small king figure and a bean (if using) in small pieces of parchment paper.\nGrease a piece of parchment paper the size of the baking tray with some oil.\nPut the dough on the kitchen countertop, put the king figure and bean inside the dough and shape the dough into a ball. Cover the dough with a towel and let it rest for 5 min.\nShape the Roscon as a ring with a big hole in the middle so that it does not close while the dough grows and bakes. Move it onto the prepared parchment paper and adjust as needed. Pull the Roscon on the baking tray with the help of the parchment paper. Cover with a towel and put in a warm place to proof for 2 more hours.\nSet the oven to heat to 180 degrees Celsius or 400 degrees Fahrenheit.\nTo brush the Roscon de Reyes, break an egg in a glass, add to it about a teaspoon of water and beat it a little with a fork.\nAdd a few drops of water to a tablespoon of sugar and mix it so that the sugar is just a little wet and forms kind of crumbs.\nBrush the Roscon gently with the egg wash. Arrange the candied fruit on top, as well as sprinkle almond flakes (optional). And sprinkle the sugar crumbs as last.\nBake the Roscon for about 20 \u2013 25 minutes till it\u2019s nicely golden brown. To prevent the Roscon from browning too much, put a piece of aluminium foil loosely on top when it has started to brown. Remove Roscon from the oven and let it cool a bit on the baking tray before moving it.\nYou can eat it the Roscon like that or cut horizontally and put whipped cream or your preferred cream filling in the middle. Enjoy!"
